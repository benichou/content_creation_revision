## Conveying the Content Brand Experience in Writing

The Company aims to reflect its brand attributes—confident, clear, and human—across all communications to differentiate itself in the market. These attributes guide writing principles to ensure impactful and engaging content.

### Brand Attributes and Writing Principles

- **Confident**: Express a clear, direct point of view. Avoid clichés, connect with important issues, and provoke thought.
- **Clear**: Be concise and focused. Use simple language, avoid jargon, and structure content logically.
- **Human**: Connect emotionally with the audience. Use a conversational tone and focus on human stories.

### Benefits of Brand Experience

Focusing on brand experience fosters emotional connections with audiences. Storytelling is a key tool, making complex concepts relatable and memorable.

### Inclusion and Content Voice

The Company emphasizes inclusive language to unite rather than divide. Avoid jargon and use language that respects diversity, such as preferred pronouns and culturally sensitive terms. Examples of non-inclusive terms include "Hey guys" and "blacklist," which should be replaced with inclusive alternatives like "folks" and "denylist."

### Fostering Inclusion

Language evolves, and the Company encourages awareness of terms with oppressive histories. Inclusive writing prioritizes clear communication and respects diverse perspectives, ensuring all audiences feel valued and understood.
