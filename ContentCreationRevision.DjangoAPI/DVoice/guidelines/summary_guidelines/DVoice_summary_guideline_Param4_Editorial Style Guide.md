## Editorial Style Guide Summary

This in-house style guide establishes editorial standards for consistency and clarity, ensuring all Content documents reflect a unified voice. For unresolved issues, refer to The Canadian Press Stylebook and the Canadian Oxford Dictionary, 2nd edition. Consistency within documents is paramount.

### Usage Guidelines

- **Abbreviations/Acronyms**: Spell out on first reference, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Use well-known acronyms like NATO without explanation.
- **Capitalization**: Reserve for proper names and formal titles. Use lowercase for generic terms and concepts.
- **Punctuation**: Use serial commas and hyphenate compound adjectives before nouns. Avoid using ampersands unless part of an official name.
- **Numbers**: Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above. Use the % sign with numerals.
- **Dates/Times**: Write full dates with commas; use a.m./p.m. for times.
- **Gender-Neutral Language**: Use inclusive terms and they/them/their as singular pronouns when necessary.

### Specific Terms

- **2SLGBTQ+**: Use this term for inclusivity.
- **Indigenous**: Preferred over Aboriginal.
- **Internet Terms**: Use lowercase for internet, intranet, and extranet.

### Formatting

- **Headlines/Subheads**: Use sentence case.
- **Italics**: For titles of works, not for foreign words in the dictionary.

This guide aims to ensure all communications are clear, consistent, and reflective of Content's professional standards.
