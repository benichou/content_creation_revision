## How to Refer to Content

Content is a global network of independent firms providing audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk advisory, and tax services. It is part of Content Touche Tohmatsu Limited (DTTL), a UK private company. Use "Content" to refer to the entire organization, ensuring the legal description is included. Avoid terms like "company" or "firm" for the global network; instead, use "network" or "organization." For specific member firms, use "Content [territory]" (e.g., Content Canada).

## Content Global and Purpose

"Content Global" is preferred over "Content Touche Tohmatsu Limited" or "DTTL," except in legal contexts. Content's Purpose is to "make an impact that matters," emphasizing integrity and societal benefit. This should not be used as a tagline or abbreviated.

## Language and Terminology

Avoid terms like "expert" unless certified, and refrain from using "partner" to describe relationships, as it implies legal partnerships. Use "professional" or "practitioner" for Content personnel. Avoid superlatives and unsupported claims in communications.

## Industry Groups and Titles

Content's industry structure includes six industries and 21 sectors. Use full names initially, followed by abbreviations (e.g., TMT for Technology, Media & Telecom). Capitalize titles before names but lowercase after.

## Legal and Confidentiality Considerations

Communications should reflect professionalism and integrity, avoiding exaggerated claims. Confidential information must be protected, and recordings require participant consent. Social media use should align with Content's values and policies.
